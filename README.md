## Project overview
In this project, we will investigate a dataset containing information about the average life expectancy in 158 different countries. We will specifically look at how a country's economic success might impact the life expectancy in that area.

## Dataset

## Tools and libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Visualizations
Plotted several histograms to visualize the distributions of the data.

## Conclusion
By analysing data we came to the conclusion that countries with **higher GDP** tends to **live longer** than those people living in lower GDP countries.
According to the sample that we were working on shows that that people living in higher GDP countries lives about **11 more years** on average than those living in lower GDP countries.
The median age in high GDP countries is **75** while the median age in low GDP countries is **64**.
